    <h1> My final Project</h1>
    <p> This is my slot machine game that is really fun to play.</p>
    <p1>This is a slot machine game like the ones at the casinos. It is a game with images friom khan. There is 1 row and 3 columns. Every imaage is random. The gaol of this game is to match all 3 pictures. If and when you match all of the pictures you win coins. IF you have more coin youu win. This game is all about luck becasue we made it so that it could be complete randomized game. Hope it is as fun as a game as it was to me. Enjoy this great game for everyone to enjoy.</p1>
